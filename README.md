# laby_python3

Python3 support on Laby application on the Linux platform.

The folder python3 contains four files. Copy this folder and its files to `/usr/share/laby/mods/`

On starting the Laby applications in the *Language* drop-down menu, then *python3* will be an 
option that you can choose.

The robot.py file that is supplied with the python3 folder provides the same functionality as the
original robot.py file with python2. i.e. There are 8 functions.

In the folder *robot files* there are alternative files that can be renamed as robot.py and used
with python3. 

These other robot.py files contain additional functions that may assist in writing 
your ant program. See the *README.md* file for a description of these additional functions.

A presentation on enhancing Laby to support python3 was delivered at the Hamilton Python Users Group
meeting on 18 May 2020. The presentation slides are attached in both odp and pdf formats.
